# Object Counting Using OpenCV
This project demonstrates a method to count the number of objects in an image using OpenCV. The process involves converting the image to grayscale, detecting edges, and identifying contours to count the objects. The project also saves the intermediary images and visualizes the process.

# Features
Convert the input image to grayscale.

Apply Gaussian blur to reduce noise.

Detect edges using the Canny edge detection algorithm.

Find and filter contours based on area to count objects.

Visualize the original image, edge-detected image, and contour-detected image.

Save intermediary images for further analysis.

# Dependencies
Python 3.x

OpenCV

Matplotlib

NumPy
